I was a little frustrated with teamwork in the previous lesson. There are two reasons for this. First, my English listening and speaking skills have always been weak. It was impossible for me to articulate my thoughts. Second, even though it was a task that didn't care if the answers were correct or not, I struggled with how to explain my understanding to my team members in the second half of the task. As a result, I didn't make any substantial contribution to this team effort.
I think the first thing I need to address now is my English skills. I think the solution to this problem is to take the initiative to make friends and communicate more. I have applied for the 'meet a local friend' program and I believe it will help me adapt faster.
